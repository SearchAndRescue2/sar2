<h4>
How do I get this program to run in full screen (fullscreen mode)?
</h4>

<p>As of version 0.8.1 you can use <code>CTRL + F11</code> to switch to
<i>full screen</i> or back to <i>windowed</i> mode while the program is 
running. In addition you can use <code>CTRL + [</code> and
<code>CTRL + ]</code> to adjust the <i>resolution</i> at any time.
</p>

<p>
For 0.7.x users:
Use the option <code>--fullscreen</code> when you run or create a shortcut
to the application. You may also want to specify the startup resolution
with the <code>--geometry WxH</code> argument.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
 <li><code>/usr/games/SearchAndRescue
--fullscreen --geometry 640x480</code>.
</ul>

<h4>
How do I specify the startup resolution?
</h4>

<p>
Use the option <code>--geometry WxH</code> when you run or 
create a shortcut to the application.
</p><p>
For example <code>/usr/games/SearchAndRescue   
--geometry 640x480</code>.
</p><p>
You can also change the resolution in game (windowed mode only) by
simply dragging the window frame. The smallest size is 100x70
(as defined in <code>config.h</code>
</p>

<h4>
How do I get it to use hardware rendering?
</h4>

<p>
By default the application specifies to use hardware
rendering to the OpenGL wrapper implmentation. The option <code>
--hardware_rendering</code> is on by default so specifying it
is meaningless.
</p><p>
If you are still having problems using hardware acceleration,
then you should run this application with the <code>
--runtime_debug</code>. It will print many initialization and runtime
messages to stdout. If you are still having problems with hardware
acceleration and other OpenGL applications seem to use hardware 
acceleration properly then you should notify the authors and be sure
to send the output from stdout when you ran with the <code>
--runtime_debug</code> argument.

<h4>
How come objects farther away are showing through closer objects
(aka bleed throughs)?
</h4>

<p>
<b>Not</b> to be confused with the <a href="#000005">
Z buffer 'miniblinds flickering effect'</a>, this is due
to <i>depth testing</i> intentionally turned off for certain objects
that are impossible to be displayed with OpenGL properly.
</p>

<p>
Technical note, this problem is caused by the need to render objects
such as heighfields over flat 2D surfaces where parts of the heightfield
are parallel and at the exact height of the 2D surface. Enabling 
OpenGL's polygon offset is not a solution as the written depth would
otherwise be incorrect. There is a high
performance cost solution to this using two passes and OpenGL's stencil
buffer, however it is not a viable solution at this time (Oct 2001).
Reffer back to this section in the future, a solution may be available
then.

<h4>
Why do some parts of the scene seem to flicker like
miniblinds (aka miniblinds flickering effect)?
</h4>

<p>
Most objects drawn over other objects in perfect parallel alignment
and at the same location will 'fight' to show though in the
depth buffer. This causes a miniblinds flickering effect, the solution
is to use a technique called polygon offsetting which this application
uses when appropriate.
</p><p>
However some systems have differences in the amount of offsetting
so sometimes the user needs to adjust this value. You can change this
value in game by pressing the <code>/</code> key to bring up the
prompt and then type in <code>option gl_polgyon_offset=-2.0</code>
A typical value can be from <code>-1.5</code> to <code>-2.0</code>
where the more negative value produces more offset. Reduce (make more
negative) this value if you are still getting a lot of
miniblinds flickering effect. Note that this changed value will be
stored in your <code>SearchAndRescue.ini</code> file.
</p>
<p>Some scenerys are partially responsible for denoting where
to use polygon offsetting and that the scenery builder/author may need
to be nofitied about the problem if specifying a lower
<code>gl_polgyon_offset</code> value does not work. If you try going below
<code>-10.0</code> without any good results, then that might indicate
it is a problem with the scenery.

<h4>
How do I recompile with debugging support and debug the program?
</h4>

<p>
(UNIX/X version only) go back to the source directory for this program
(or download it again if you deleted it) and type the following
command on your shell prompt
(you may have to replace some values to suit your system):
<ul>
 <li><code>./configure linux -v --prefix=/usr --enable="debug" 
--disable="arch-i586"
</code>

</ul>
The above command assumes you are using Linux and that your computer is
an Intel Pentium 586 (i586). If you have a 486, then change
<code>arch-i586</code> to <code>arch-i486</code>. Use the command
<code>uname -m</code> to find out which one you have.
</p>

<p>
If the source (re)configuration worked, then type
<ul>
 <li><code>make clean</code>
 <li><code>make</code>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If everything was successful then you can begin the debugging
process (this assumes you've already ran <code>make install</code>
earlier). Run <code>gdb sar/SearchAndRescue</code>, this will run
the GNU Debugger (gdb). Once you are in gdb, type <code>run</code>
to run the program. When/if the program crashes, type <code>bt</code>
to display the <i>backtrace</i>. Besure to send the backtrace to
the authors as needed. Type <code>quit</code> to quit gdb, note that gdb
will ask if you want to quit while the program crashed but is still
running. Say yes to that.

<h4>
Why do I get wierd colors or missing objects using an ATI Rage 128?
</h4>

<p>
Be sure to compile the kernel with modular support for DRI,
use the DRI kernel module for the rage128 called <code>r128.o</code> from
<a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.xfree86.org/~alanh">
http://www.xfree86.org/~alanh</a>. Some older modules may cause
unusual color behavour, try upgrading to the latest module
if you are experiencing this problem.

<h4>
Cursor keys do not respond at all using keyboard as controller?
</h4>

<p>
This problem has been reported on some Debian Linux systems when
running SAR 0.7.20 or newer, its exact cause is unknown. However the
solution has been to manually remove the file
<code>$HOME/.SearchAndRescue/SearchAndRescue.ini</code>
and then running <code>SearchAndRescue</code> so that it regenerates
a new configuration file with default values. Although there are no key
bindings in that file, the removal of that file has been reported
to resolve this problem.
</p>

<p>
Next potential problem is that SAR was compiled with gcc 2.95.
This has been reported to generate a bad binary (possibly in
the Flight Dynamics modules). Try using a different compiler,
we recommend egcs or gcc 3.0.
