<h3>Preplanning</h3>

<p>There are no significent issues regarding the importing of LWO
aircraft files at this time, please refer to the
<a href="lwoimporthowto.html">LWO Import HOWTO</a>
for general preplanning issues.

<h3>LWO Preparation</h3>

<p>The key to preparation is breaking down the aircraft into
<i>parts</i>.
</p>

<p>First you need to <b>consider</b>, <b>identify</b>, and
<b>isolate</b> all of the parts in your LWO file that may have a unique
and particular function. These parts are often the:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Fuselage
 <li>Shadow
 <li>Landing Gears (skis, wheels, struts, gear bay doors)
 <li>Doors
 <li>Rotors
 <li>Air Brakes
 <li>Ailerons, Elevators, Canards, or Rudders
 <li>External Fuel Tanks
</ul>

<p>Not all types of aircraft will have all of the parts listed above.
</p>

<p>It is recommended that you <b>save as</b> your LWO file to a
different file name since you may need to modify it for the purposes of
accomidating Search and Rescue's requirements.
</p>

<p>After you have <b>considered</b> and <b>identified</b> each part, you 
need to <b>isolate</b> each one (by <b>selecting</b> it in LightWave 3D)
and  <b>save</b> it to a <u>separate LWO file</u> as an object (as a
<i>part</i>). Some additional modifications on the LWO file you just
saved may be required, these modifications include <b>translating</b>,
<b>rotating</b>, and <b>recoloring</b>.
</p>

<p>Below are instructions specific to certain parts.</p>


<a name="prepmovableparts">
<h3>Movable Parts In General</h3>

<p>Movable parts should be saved to separate LWO files as mentioned 
above, however you should also take into consideration <u>how the part
moves.</u>

</p>
For example a landing gear that is a wheel (imagine the nose gear of the 
HH-65) deploys and retracts by rotating about the aircraft's X axis.
The landing gear model should be saved in its down/deployed state.
Since center of rotation is at the top of the gear strut, you need
to <b>translate</b> the landing gear so that the center of the model
is at the top of the gear strut (for most cases).
</p>

<p>Almost all parts (except the fuselage and shadow) are considered
<i>movable parts</i>, the air brakes, ailerons, elevators, canards, 
and rudders are good examples of simple parts that move.
</p>

<p>Another simple example would be that of a rudder. You would need to 
<b>isolate</b> (<b>select</b>) the rudder and <b>save</b> it to a
<u>separate LWO file</u>. It should be <b>translated</b> so that it
<u>rotates about the Z axis</u> (for most cases).
</p>


<p><img src="icon_bulb.gif" border=0 valign=center>
Note in some cases (for example) a rudder may not be fully upright (that
it pitches downwards or upwards), in such a case you should still leave
the rudder fully upright so that it still rotates about the Z axis.
The SAR aircraft file will specify additional complex rotations that
you do not need to in an LWO file.
</p>


<a name="prepfuselage">
<h3>Fuselage</h3>

<p>If you have <i>windows</i> on the fuselage (and most aircraft do have 
windows), you should <b>save</b> the windows to a <u>separate LWO
file</u>.
</p>

<p>If you intend to use a <i>texture</i> for the fuselage then you 
should <b>split</b> the fuselage <u>in half</u> so that you have two 
sides (a left and right side) and <b>save</b> them to <u>separate LWO
files</u>. <b>Recolor</b> the entire fuselage <u>pure white</u>.
</p>

<p>If the aircraft has doors that open, exposing the interior of
the fuselage, then you may want to <b>isolate</b> the interior of the
fuselage and <b>save</b> it to a <u>separate LWO file</u>.
</p>


<a name="preplandinggears">
<h3>Landing Gears</h3>

<p><img src="icon_info.gif" border=0 valign=center>
Search and Rescue requires that <u>at least one separate model act as 
the landing gear</u>. So even if the aircraft has fixed skis or wheels,
you need to <b>save</b> the skis or <u>each</u> wheel to a <u>separate 
LWO file</u>.
</p>

<p>Landing gears can be wheels, skis, gear bay doors, etc. Below, we 
explain how to handle the common types of landing gears.
</p>

<p>For <i>skis</i> <b>save</b> the skis as <u>one whole part</u> to
an LWO file. Since they do not move you do <b>not</b> need to translate
it.
</p>

<p>For <i>wheels</i> <b>save</b> the <u>wheel and the strut</u> to an
LWO file. If the gear rotates to deploy/retract then <b>translate</b> it 
so that the gear's <i>center of rotation</i> is at the top of the strut.
</p>

<p>For <i>gear bay doors</i> <b>save</b> the <u>door</u> to an LWO file.
If the gear bay door rotates to open/close then <b>translate</b> it so 
that the door's <i>center of rotation</i> is at its <u>hindge</u>.
</p>


<a name="prepdoors">
<h3>Doors</h3>

<p>If you want a door on the aircraft to open and close while acting as 
the <i>primary rescue door</i> then you should <b>save</b> that door to 
a <u>separate LWO file</u>.
</p>

<p>The door should be in its <u>closed position</u>, <b>translate</b>
the door to its <u><i>rotational center</i></u> (its hindges).
If the door only slides open then there is no need to translate it.
</p>

<p>If the door is intended to be textured then follow the same procedure 
for the <a href="#prepfuselage">fuselage</a>.
</p>


<a name="preprotors">
<h3>Rotors</h3>

<p>The <i>rotors</i> in Search and Rescue spin about the Z axis, this 
means that all rotors (even tail rotors on helicopters) <i>rotate about 
the Z axis</i>.
</p>

<p><u>Each set of blades is considered <i>one rotor</i></u>. So you need
to isolate the rotor blades only, but <b>not</b> the struts, housing, or
other cylendrical like details (leave them on the fuselage).
</p>

<p>Once you hve isolated <i>one rotor</i> you need to <b>translate</b>
and <b>rotate</b> it such that its <i>center of rotation</i> and 
attitude would <u>spin about the Z axis</u>. Then <b>save</b> it to an
<u>LWO file</u>.
</p>

<p><img src="icon_warning.gif" border=0 valign=center>
Remember that tail rotors spin about the Z axis (not the X axis) so
you need to <b>rotate</b> it accordingly. You specify in the V3D
aircraft file that it is a tail rotor and bank it 90 or 270 degrees
to achieve the appropriate affect.
</p>


<a name="prefexternalfueltank">
<h3>External Fuel Tanks</h3>

<p>Each <i>external fuel tank</i> must be <b>saved</b> to a
<u>separate LWO file</u>. It needs to be <b>translated</b> to its 
<u><i>center of rotation</i></u>, this is required because once the
fuel tank is dropped it becomes its own object and may need to rotate
accordingly.
</p>

<h3>Importing</h3>

<p>For basic information on importing, please refer to the
<a href="lwoimporthowto.html">LWO Import HOWTO</a>.
</p>

<p>You will need to <b>import</b> each <u>LWO file into your
V3D Aircraft file</u> using Vertex 3D. Follow the V3D Aircraft file
design when you import each LWO file. After you import you may still 
need to create addition models in your V3D Aircraft file, things such as 
"other data" models, cockpit model, shadow model, far view model, etc.
