<h3>Flying</h3>

<p>
Here you will learn how to fly the aircrafts, everything from
basic flight manuvers like take offs and landings to navigation and
rescue.
</p>

<p>
Search and Rescue is not, by most standards, a realistic flight 
simulator. It focuses more on entertainment rather than authenticity,
so flying is not too difficult and the learning curve is simple.

<h3>Controlling The Aircraft</h3>

<p>
For the helicopter there are 4 basic compoents to its control.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><i>heading</i>
 <li><i>Pitch</i>
 <li><i>Bank</i>
 <li><i>Throttle/Collective</i>
</ul>

<p>The helicopter's movement is controlled by tilting the rotors 
in various angles to cause it to move and gain momentum in a 
desired direction. The helicopter gains altitude by increasing power to
the main rotor which makes it spin faster and create more thrust. In 
addition the altitude can be fine tuned with the collective which 
adjusts the angle of the rotor blades to fine tune the amount of thrust 
desired.
</p>

<table>

 <tr>
  <td width=0% align=left valign=top>
<h4>Pitch</h4>
<p>The <i>pitch</i> is the angle of the helicopter's nose with the 
horizon, the pitch can go down or up. Pitch is the most sensitive and 
oscilating aspect of controlling the helicopter. When the helicopter
pitches down it causes the direction of the thrust to point sligntly
behind it which gives it a compoent of thrust that pushes it forward.
</p>
<p>
You can control the <i>pitch</i> with the joystick's pitch axis
or by pressing <code>DOWN</code> or <code>UP</code>. The <i>pitch</i> 
can also be fine tuned using the elevator/pitch trim by pressing 
<code>HOME</code> or <code>END</code> (<code>CTRL + HOME</code> to
center the trim).

  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td width=0% align=left valign=top>
<h4>Bank</h4>
<p>The <i>bank</i> is the tiling of the helicopter to either side. This 
affect is slightly more complex than the <i>pitch</i>. If the helicopter 
tilts to the side (<i>banks</i>) with the <i>pitch</i> <u>remaining 
level</u>, then the thrust from the helicopter's main rotor causes the
helicopter to <u>fly sideways</u>. If the helicopter tilts to the side
(<i>banks</i>) and is <i>pitched</i> forwards then the helicopter's main 
rotor creates thrust in <u>many directions</u> causing it to 
<u>turn</u> instead of just flying sideways.
</p>
<p>
You can control the <i>bank</i> with the joystick's bank axis
or by pressing <code>LEFT</code> or <code>RIGHT</code>.

  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td width=0% align=left valign=top>
<h4>Heading</h4>
<p>The <i>heading</i> is the direction that the helicopter is flying,
it can be changed by the tail rotor. The tail rotor adds thrust or
eliminates thrust that counteracts the main rotor's rotational 
momentum. This causes the helicopter's direction to change.
</p>
<p>If the helicopter has forwards or sideways momentum and the
<i>heading</i> changes then it causes a <u>great loss</u> in momentum in 
the direction in question. This is why heading should be changed in
small amounts.
</p>
<p>
You can control the <i>heading</i> with the joystick's heading axis
or by pressing <code>CTRL + LEFT</code> or <code>CTRL + RIGHT</code>.
If your joystick does not have a heading axis then press and hold
the joystick's rotate modifier button (see joystick button 
mappings) in conjunction with the bank axis.

 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td width=0% align=left valign=top>
<h4>Throttle/Collective</h4>
<p>The <i>throttle</i> controls how fast the engine spins the rotors. 
The faster the rotors spin the more power is available to create thrust.
This thrust is used primarly to gain altitude.  The tilting of the main 
rotor causes the thrust to be directed in the direction you want to 
move.
</p>
<p>The <i>throttle</i> controls only one aspect of thrust, the 
<i>collective</i> fine tunes the amount of thrust resulting from the 
power of the spinning rotor blades. The <i>collective</i> adjusts the
angle of the rotor blades (see diagram on the right) to produce more or 
less thrust, basically it fine tunes the amount of thrust so that the
altitude can be controlled with precision.
</p>
<p>You can control the <i>collective</i> with the joystick's
throttle axis or by pressing <code>PGUP</code> or <code>PGDN</code>
(holding down <code>SHIFT</code> increases the amount of change).

<h3>Flight Physics</h3>
<p>
The <i>flight physics</i> determines how sensitive and realistic the 
controls behave. You can change the <i>flight physics</i> by going to
Option-&gt;Simulation... or during simulaton by pressing
<code>CTRL + D</code>. The settings are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Easy - All controls have nullzones and engine response is immediate
 <li>Moderate - Some controls have nullzones and engine response is slightly delayed
 <li>Authentic - Controls are extremely sensitive and engine response is delayed
</ul>

<h3>Engine &amp; Fuel</h3>
<p>
The engine uses more fuel when you increase the 
<i>throttle/collective</i>. To see the <i>fuel status</i> press
<code>F</code>. You can also <b>transfer</b> fuel from <i>reserved or
external fuel tanks</i> (if the aircraft has them) by pressing
<code>SHIFT + F</code>. To <b>drop</b> (jetteson) <i>external fuel
tanks</i> press <code>CTRL + F</code>.
</p>

<p>To turn the engine on press <code>E</code>. The engine takes a few 
seconds to start up (depending on the <i>flight physics</i>). If
starting the engine while the aircraft is already airborne with the 
rotor blades spinning, then the engine will start up almost immediately.
</p>

<p>
To turn the engine off press <code>SHIFT + E</code>. Note that there is
rarely a reason to turn the engines off while in flight.
</p>

<h3>Take Off &amp; Flight</h3>
<p>Once the engine is on and you are familiar with the helicopter's 
controls (see above), slowly increase the <i>throttle/collective</i>
until you begin to lift off the ground.  Make sure that you are 
at least 100 feet above the ground before you attempt to tilt the
helicopter and begin moving.
</p>

<p>
Once the helicopter is airborne, you can tilt the helicopter 
pitch down to begin moving forwards.  Pitch down just a few degrees to 
see how much of a momentum it creates.
</p>

<p><img src="icon_info.gif" border=0 valign=center>
When you are moving forward, practice banking and turning.  Tilt in 
small amounts at first to stay in a safe flying situation.  Each
helicopter has its unique handling responses, some have a lot of power 
and can accelerate quickly, others are more forgiving and require more 
tilting to achieve the desired momentum.

<h3>Landing</h3>

<img src="flying_landing.png" align=right border=0
 alt="LANDING"
>
<p>Landing a helicopter is more challenging than simply taking off. To 
land a helicopter, first you must find a spot to land (such as a 
helipad), manuver the helicopter over it (the approach), and then set
it down gently.
</p>

<p>In most cases it is easiest to land using the <i>spot view</i>
(press <code>F3</code>). Adjust the
<a href="views.html#camera">
camera position</a> so that you see both your helicopter and the
desired landing site (usually a helipad) at once (see image on the
right).
</p>

<p>As you approach the helipad, slowly reduce your speed (level the 
helicopter to minimize any tilt) and reduce the collective until you 
slowly begin to descend (watch the rate of climb (ROC) and the 
altitude closely). Make sure that you stay a safe distance above 
the ground until you are over the helipad.
</p>

<p>With the airspeed decreasing, pitch down slightly to apply a
small amount of thrust for forward motion as needed. You can adjust the
heading as needed, but do not bank too much or else the helicopter will
move sideways due to the slow speed. If the helicopter has retractable
landing gears then make sure the landing gears are down (press
<code>G</code>).
</p>

<p><img src="icon_bulb.gif" border=0 valign=center>
As you descend and get closer to the ground you will see the
helicopter's shadow and prop wash, use it as a guide to judge where you
are with respect to where you want to land.
</p>

<p>Slowly position the helicopter over the landing site, keeping a safe 
altitude above the ground (at least 20 feet).  Some helipads can be 
located on top of buildings, mountains, vehicles, or vessels, make sure 
that you remain a safe altitude above the helipad to avoid hitting any 
obstructions along the way.
Tilt the rotors sparingly to gently nudge the helicopter into position.  
Once the helicopter is over the landing site decrease the collective and 
let the helicopter touch down.
</p>

<p>Once landed at a helipad, you can refuel, repair, and drop off 
passengers (press <code>R</code>). Note that not all helipads support 
refueling, repairs, or allow the dropping off of passengers.
</p>

<p><img src="icon_info.gif" border=0 valign=center>
You can land on virtually any hard surface. If the aircraft has floats
then you can also land on water. Most building rooftops are landable
(even ones without helipads).
</p>

<p>
You can adjust the <i>damage resistance</i> by going to
Options-&gt;Simulation... The <i>damage resistance</i> determines how 
"hard" you can hit the ground and/or at how steep of an angle.

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<img src="map.png" align=right border=0
 alt="MAP VIEW"
>
<p>Most theaters in Search and Rescue are considered small, so long 
range navigation is rarely needed. There are basically two forms of
navigation that are needed for long distance flights:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>By <i>waypoints</i>.
 <li>By <a href="views.html#map"><i>map view</i></a>.
</ul>

<p>When you fly missions, the <i>waypoints</i> have been set and all you
need to do is follow them on the heading display (displayed on both the
cockpit HUD and outside views). Press <code>W</code> to change
<i>waypoints</i>. The <i>waypoints</i> are also displayed as lines when
you view them on the map (press <code>M</code> to see the map).
</p>

<p>You can also fly using the map alone, when you are in the map view
(press <code>M</code>) use the joystick hat and zoom buttons to pan 
around and find your destination. You can always press
<code>BACKSPACE</code> to jump to your aircraft's current position.
Holding down the <code>SHIFT</code> key while using the joystick hat or
zoom buttons will increase the amount of scroll and zooming.

<h3>Rescuing</h3>

<table>
 <tr>
  <td width=100% align=left valign=top>

<p>Rescuing victims is often considered the most difficult part of 
Search and Rescue.  First you need to find the victim (which is 
virtually a "needle in a haystack"), manuver the aircraft over the 
victim, and then use the hoist to pick up the victim.
</p>

<p>On most missions, the <i>waypoints</i> are <u>already</u> set to the 
location of the victim (or near the victim).  Once you reach the 
location of where the victim was reported to be by the <i>waypoint</i> 
you need to begin searching for that victim by flying around the area.
Make sure that you do not stray too far away from the search area, the 
victim is <u>typically within a few miles of the <i>waypoint</i></u>. 
Using the <i>spot view</i> (press <code>F3</code>) often gives you a 
better vantage point while searching for victims.
</p>

<p>At night you should use the <i>spot light</i> to help search for
victims, press <code>L</code> to turn on the <i>spot light</i> and hold
the <code>CTRL</code> key down while using the joystick hat to move the
<i>spot light</i> around. It's best to move the <i>spot light</i> 
around in conjunction with moving the camera around in order to cover a
broader area.
</p>

<p><img src="icon_info.gif" border=0 valign=center>
<i>Night vision</i> (FLIR) also helps, press <code>I</code> to toggle
the FLIR (see image on right).
</p>

<p><img src="icon_bulb.gif" border=0 valign=center>
The <i>spot view</i> (press <code>F3</code>) is considered the best
vantage point in the search for victims. Move the camera around to help
cover a broader region of the search area.
</p>


<p>Once you have spotted a victim, you need to <b>manuver</b> the
helicopter over that victim. This is similar to landing but make sure
that you stay at least 20 feet above the ground. <b>Level</b> the
helicopter to reduce momentum, <b>tilt</b> the rotors <u>sparingly</u>
to nudge the helicopter over the victim (<u>this takes a lot of
practice</u>).
</p>

<p>If you are picking up a victim over land, then you can simply land 
next to the victim and let the victim come to you. However, if you are 
<i>over water</i> then you need to <b>use the hoist</b> to lower a
rescue basket or diver (press <code>P</code> to change the hoist
deployment) to the victim.  Use the joystick's hoist lower/raise buttons
or press <code>CTRL + PLUS</code> or <code>CTRL + MINUS</code> to raise
and lower the hoist's deployment.
</p>

<p><img src="icon_warning.gif" border=0 valign=center>
<b>Watch</b> the <i>Rate Of Climb (ROC)</i> and the <i>Altitude</i> 
closely, <b>adjust</b> the <i>Collective</i> to maintain a <u>safe 
distance</u> above the ground or water. Once you are at the desired
altitude (about 20 feet above ground) you can use <i>Autohover</i> (press
<code>A</code>) to lock the altitude. <u>Be careful not to hit the water
or else the aircraft will sink!</u>
</p>

<p>Once you have the victim, <b>raise</b> the hoist deployment in order
to pull the victim up into the helicopter.

<h3>Crashing</h3>

<p>There are several ways that you can crash or damage the 
aircraft in Search and Rescue:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Landing too hard
(<font color="#ff0000">crash</font> or <font color="#808000">damage</font>).
 <li>Landing at too steep of an angle
(<font color="#ff0000">crash</font>).
 <li>Landing in water when the aircraft does not have floats
(<font color="#ff0000">splash</font>).
 <li>Flying into buildings or obstructions
(<font color="#ff0000">crash</font>).
 <li>Flying too fast and exceeding the <i>overspeed</i> limit
(<font color="#808000">damage</font>).
</ul>

<p>If you crash during <i>free flight</i> then you can press 
<code>SPACE</code> to start over at the nearest helipad. The aircraft
will be fully repaired and refueled, but any passengers on board will
be lost.
</p>

<p>If you crash during a <i>mission</i> then (typically) the mission is 
over
and you have failed the mission.
