# Introduction
# ------------
#
# Contains a list relating music files to special id codes used by the 
# program to know which music file to play, by matching the code with an
# entry found in this file and taking the file name referenced in the 
# entry to an actual music file.
#
#
# Notes
# -----
#
# Below is table of id codes and their verbose description
#
#	ID	Description
#
#	0	Default/splash music
#
#	10	Menus (repeating)
#	50	Loading simulation (repeating)
#	60	Mission failed
#	61	Mission success
#
#	100	Simulation on ground (repeating)
#	101	Simulation on ground entering
#	110	Simulation in flight day time (repeating)
#	111	Simulation in flight day time  entering
#	120	Simulation in flight night time (repeating)
#	121	Simulation in flight night time entering
#	150	Simulation rescuing (repeating)
#	151	Simulation rescuing entering
#
# The ones labeled `(repeating)' in their description mean that the music
# is intended to be repeating. If it is not labeled as such then it is
# intended to be placed once. Some may be labeled as `entering', this
# means the song is played once and then their counterpart is placed after
# wards (their counterpart is usually a repeating song).
#

# First entry is the default, it should also be the splash (id 0).
