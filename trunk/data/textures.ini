#                       SAR Texture References List
#
# Introduction
# ------------
#
# Contains a list of texture reference names and associated file names
# to be loaded whenever a scene (.scn file) is to be loaded.
#
# Try to keep the list as minimal as possable, only the basic textures
# that you know you will need most of the time should be loaded.
#
# All texture reference names specific to the game (the game's basic
# exected to exist textures) should be prefixed with sar_ in their
# reference names.
#
#
# Notes
# -----
#
# First argument to TextureAdd is the texture reference name. It is
# not case sensitive and may not contain white spaces. Avoid using
# any funny characters.
#
# The local data directory will be prefixed to the value of
# TextureFileName and checked if the file exists, if not then the
# global data directory will be prefixed to the value of TextureFileName
# and then checked if the file exists (UNIX version only). It's always
# best to use a relative path statement.
#
# TexturePriority specifies the urgency of the texture to be placed into
# resident texture memory. Higher values will make the texture more likly
# to be placed into resident texture memory.
#


# Celestial
#
# These textures are greyscale unless otherwise noted where pure black is
# transparent. These texture names are used internally by the program by
# may be used in scenery and objects as long as they are not overloaded
# by the scenery or object file.
#
# All celestial textures are displayed as billboards.
