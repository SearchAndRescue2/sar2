STEP 0: Before you Begin
------------------------

        Before you try to build and install Search and Rescue II, you'll
        need to have some packages installed. What follows
        are a list of libraries and their package names on OpenSuse 
        distributions.

        Name       -- Package name
        Mesa       -- Mesa-devel
        FreeALUT   -- freealut-devel
        OpenAL     -- openal-soft-devel
        gcc-c++    -- gcc-c++
        Vorbis     -- libvorbis-devel
        Scons      -- scons
        Xorg/X11   -- xorg-x11-libICE-devel, xorg-x11-libSM-devel
                      xorg-x11-libX11-devel, xorg-x11-libXext-devel
                      xorg-x11-libXmu-devel, xorg-x11-libXpm-devel
        SDL        -- libSDL-devel

        If you find additional dependencies which are not included in your
        distribution, please report them so we can add them to the list.

------------------------
STEP 1: Building the source
------------------------

        You will need 'scons'. To build the program type:

        # scons

        The 'sar2' file will be generated in the 'bin' folder. From this point
        you can play the game you by running (from the base game folder):

        # ./sar2.sh

        (Note: 'sar2.sh' will compile the program if no 'bin/sar2' is found)

------------------------ 
STEP 2: Installing
------------------------ 

        To install the game system-wide, along with manuals, icon and menu
        entries, su to root and type:

        # ./install.sh

        These are some important files that will be installed:

        '/usr/bin/sar2' for the binary executable.
        '/usr/share/sar2/' for the data files.
        '/usr/share/man/man6/SearchAndRescue.6.bz2' for the manual.
        '$HOME/.config/sar2' for the game configuration.

------------------------
STEP 3: Running
------------------------

        To run this program type:

        # sar2

        For additional command line options, type:

        # sar2 --help

        Or for more detailed help, read the manual page:

        # man sar2

-------------
OTHER OPTIONS
-------------

        To remove a system-wide installation, please run:

        # ./uninstall

        as root.

        To cleanup the project after building it, run:

        # scons -c

                                                         --------------------
                                                         SEARCH AND RESCUE II
