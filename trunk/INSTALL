------------------------
STEP 0: Before you Begin
------------------------

	Before you try to build and install Search and Rescue, you'll
	need to have some other packages installed first. What follows
	are a list of libraries and their package names on Debian (and
	Debian related) distributions.

	Name       -- Package name
	X11        -- libx11-6
	X11 SM     -- libsm-dev
        X11 i      -- libx1-dev
	X11 XMU    -- libxmu-dev
	SDL        -- libsdl1.2-dev (optional for sound)
	SDL Mixer  -- libsdl-mixer1.2-dev (option for sound)
	OpenGL     -- libglu1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa-dev
	X11 ICE    -- libice6
	X11 Pixmap -- libXpm-dev

	If you find additional dependencies which are not included in your
	distribution, please report them so we can add them to the list.

-----------------------
QUICKSTART
-----------------------
	You will need 'scons' (http://www.scons.org) to build the program. Type:

	# ./sar2

	The game will be compiled if it has not been built
	before and started right after.

------------------------
STEP 1: Building the source
------------------------

	You will need 'scons'. To build the program type:

	# scons

	The 'sar2' file will be generated in the 'bin' folder. From this point
	you can play the game you by running:

	# sar2.sh

	(Note: 'sar2.sh' will compile the program if no 'bin/sar2' is found)

------------------------ 
STEP 2: Installing
------------------------ 

	To install the game system-wide, along with manuals, icon and menu
        entries, su to root and type:

	# ./install.sh

	These are some important files that will be installed:

	'/usr/bin/sar2' for the binary executable.
	'/usr/share/games/sar2/' for the data files.
	'/usr/man/man6/SearchAndRescue.6.bz2' for the manual.
	'$HOME/.config/sar2' for the game configuration.

------------------------
STEP 3: Running
------------------------

	To run this program type:

	# sar2 &

        For additional command line options, type:

        # sar2 --help

	Or for more detailed help, read the manual page:

	# man sar2

OTHER OPTIONS
-------------

        To remove a system-wide installation, please run:

        # ./uninstall

        as root.

        To cleanup the project after building it, run:

        # ./cleanup.sh

                                                         -------------------
