SAR2 FEATURES

     "Search and Rescue II" is a fork of the game Search and Rescue
     (searchandrescue.sf.net).
     
     Among the features of SaR II are smoother graphics, full SDL 
     Joystick support, playable music, bugfixes and the Guadarrama addon packed in.
     Unlike SaR, SaR II can be played without having to install it system-wide.

     Additionally, libjsw support and Y2 support have been removed 
     because they are obsolete.

     SaR II is now compiled with the help of 'scons', missing some of the
     original game multi-platform build options.
