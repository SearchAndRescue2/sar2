Version 2.1.0:
        Hector Sanjuan <hector@convivencial.org>
               * Use SDL_PlayMusic() for game music
               * Improve engine sound handling (fade as camera goes away,
                 mute when map view is active, in/outside cockpit switch)
               * Converted music to OGG
               * Fixed sar2.sh quickstart file

Version 2.0.0:
        Hector Sanjuan <hector@convivencial.org>
               * Removed Y2 sound server support.
               * Removed libjsw joystick support.
               * Extended and fixed SDL joystick support to 
                 handle axis properly, read buttons and work on the 
                 menu test page.
               * Enabled linear filtering for texture maximization
                 (smoother graphics) and mipmaps for texture minimization.
               * Fixed path handling in model views to build the texture
                 paths considering the user-defined data location path.
                 Side effect: texture_absolute_path is now ignored.
               * Added the 'Guadarrama addon' and associated bugfix patches
                 in the game data and sources.
               * Added welcome_message parameter to the scenery
                 files. Welcome message is displayed at the begginning
                 of any game (mission,freeflight) in that scenario.
               * Converted music files to .wav so they can be handled
                 by the SDL library.
               * Removed custom autoconf files and older build system.
               * Added scons-based scripts to build the game for Linux.
               * Added install.sh, uninstall.sh, makedist.sh scripts.
               * Added sar2.sh script, which allows the build and run
                 the game locally, without installation.
               * Included data files in the data/ folder. Renamed
                 source folder to src/ and included bin/, build/ folders.
               * Adapted AUTHORS, README, INSTALL... files to SaR2 
                 release.
               * Resized menu-background so they look a bit smoother
                 with higher resolutions.
               * Improve smoke effect so it does not move up straight
                 on the same line.
               * Added crash detection when touching fires.
