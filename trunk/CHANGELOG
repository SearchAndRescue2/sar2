        Hector Sanjuan <hector@convivencial.org>
               * Added buildings to Madrid city (many randomly 
                 generated, and some manually) (r119).
               * Added two new missions: "Guadarrama 7: 
                 Madrid city view" (r116) and "Guadarrama 8: 
                 Helicopter demonstration" (r129).
               * Updated icon paths in config.h (r114).
               * Added a Ruby script to generate cities randomly
                 according to certain limits (translation, size...)
                 (r115, r128).
               * Added a Ruby script to generate crowds of people
                 randomly (r127).
               * Fixed sticky key bug when playing with keyboard only
                 (r124).
               * Enabled 1 passenger to board Bell b47 aircraft by 
                 adding a door to it. (r118).
               * Improved scons compilation script (r120).
               * Workaround b47-related bug not detecting correctly
                 the objects on which it landed. (r121).
               * Separate the drop-off passengers action from repair,
                 refuel. Allow to do it in missions. (r122).
               * Renamed user configuration file from SearchAndRescue.ini
                 to sar2.ini. Please rename old file in ~/.config/sar2
                 if you need to keep user prefs. Fixed "SearchAndRescue"
                 command reference in "usage" help. (r126).
               * Speed up default frame rates for explosions, splashes
                 and fires (needs to be changed manually in .config/sar2.ini
                 if this  file was present from previous game versions).
                 (feature #3202233, r123).
               * Guadarrama scenario mission files have been renamed
                 and they appear first in mission list now (r130).
Version 2.3.0:
        Hector Sanjuan <hector@convivencial.org>
               * Replaced all Guadarrama scenery textures with
                 public domain textures. Updated coordinates of
                 all objects in the scenery and in the
                 missions (r103).
               * Increased the minimum distance for humans to
                 run towards the helicopter (r101).
               * The makedist script generates a bzipped tarball,
                 which reaches larger compression rates than gzip.
                 (r102).
               * Fix menu lists displaying one more element
                 than those fitting in the window size
                 (bug #3315466, r105).
               * Track sounds played via SoundStartPlayVoid(),
                 so the buffer and the source can be deleted
                 correctly (r104).
Version 2.2.1:
        Hector Sanjuan <hector@convivencial.org>
               * Removed SDL_Mixer dependency.
               * Fixed some warnings
               * Replaced the calls to alutLoadWAV() functions
                 as they are deprecated.
               * Fixed openAL error messages at exit
                 (bug #3288558).
Version 2.2.0:
        Hector Sanjuan <hector@convivencial.org>
               * Added OpenAL support for sounds and music
               * Modify engine sound pitch according to throttle
                 if using OpenAL
               * Humans don't run towards the helicopter unless
                 the engines are nearly off
               * Helicopter engines are now off by default. Manual
                 start required.
               * Do not spam console with "setting up fire" messages
                 (inspired from SaR)
               * Fixed crash sounds overflow. Crash sounds are played
                 once and not in every game loop without control
                 (bug #3202204)
Version 2.1.0:
        Hector Sanjuan <hector@convivencial.org>
               * Use SDL_PlayMusic() for game music
               * Improve engine sound handling (fade as camera goes away,
                 mute when map view is active, in/outside cockpit switch)
               * Converted music to OGG
               * Fixed sar2.sh quickstart file

Version 2.0.0:
        Hector Sanjuan <hector@convivencial.org>
               * Removed Y2 sound server support.
               * Removed libjsw joystick support.
               * Extended and fixed SDL joystick support to
                 handle axis properly, read buttons and work on the
                 menu test page.
               * Enabled linear filtering for texture maximization
                 (smoother graphics) and mipmaps for texture minimization.
               * Fixed path handling in model views to build the texture
                 paths considering the user-defined data location path.
                 Side effect: texture_absolute_path is now ignored.
               * Added the 'Guadarrama addon' and associated bugfix patches
                 in the game data and sources.
               * Added welcome_message parameter to the scenery
                 files. Welcome message is displayed at the begginning
                 of any game (mission,freeflight) in that scenario.
               * Converted music files to .wav so they can be handled
                 by the SDL library.
               * Removed custom autoconf files and older build system.
               * Added scons-based scripts to build the game for Linux.
               * Added install.sh, uninstall.sh, makedist.sh scripts.
               * Added sar2.sh script, which allows the build and run
                 the game locally, without installation.
               * Included data files in the data/ folder. Renamed
                 source folder to src/ and included bin/, build/ folders.
               * Adapted AUTHORS, README, INSTALL... files to SaR2
                 release.
               * Resized menu-background so they look a bit smoother
                 with higher resolutions.
               * Improve smoke effect so it does not move up straight
                 on the same line.
               * Added crash detection when touching fires.
